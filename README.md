Tejris
======

A falling blocks line making game.


Installation
------------
You need to have a copy of Slick2D in order to run Tejris.  Unfortunately, it's
not available from Maven yet.  You'll need to grab a copy of Slick2D and build
it locally.

    git clone git://github.com/nguillaumin/slick2d-maven.git
    cd slick2d-maven
    mvn clean install

Now that you have Slick2D in your local Maven repository you should be able to
build Tejris just fine.
